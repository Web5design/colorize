ABOUT:
  This is a short (no, it's not short anymore :) perl  script  to  colorize'
  your logs. You can use your own colors, you can simply modify your config
  file in your home directory, or system-wide (/etc/colorize).	Some  colors
  are shit, 'cause i start the script on my sisters' mono vga  monitor.   If
  you have a good "theme", i please you, to send me, and  i  will  put	into
  tarball.

INSTALL:
  Put somewhere in your path.  Or just set the	PATH  environment  variable.

  You will need a Perl module called Term::ANSIColor  by  Russ	Allbery  and
  Zenin (thanks for it).
	
  You can download from the CPAN archive:
    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Term/ ,
  or (when you use Debian GNU/Linux potato) simply type:
    apt-get install libansicolor-perl

USAGE:
  Just pipe the logs in the script, and	have fun.

EXAMPLE:
  cat /var/log/daemon.log | colorize
  tail -0f /var/log/daemon.log /var/log/apache/access.log | colorize
  colorize < /var/log/messages

TIPS:
  In TIPS file and in examples directory.
